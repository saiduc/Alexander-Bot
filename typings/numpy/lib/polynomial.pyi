def poly(seq_of_zeros):

    Find the coefficients of a polynomial with the given sequence of roots.

    Returns the coefficients of the polynomial whose leading coefficient
    is one for the given sequence of zeros (multiple roots must be included
    in the sequence as many times as their multiplicity; see Examples).
    A square matrix (or array, which will be treated as a matrix) can also
    be given, in which case the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial
    of the matrix are returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq_of_zeros : array_like, shape (N,) or (N, N)
        A sequence of polynomial roots, or a square array or matrix object.

    Returns
    -------
    c : ndarray
        1D array of polynomial coefficients from highest to lowest degree:

        ``c[0] * x**(N) + c[1] * x**(N-1) + ... + c[N-1] * x + c[N]``

    Notes
    -----
    Specifying the roots of a polynomial still leaves one degree of
    freedom, typically represented by an undetermined leading
    coefficient. [1]_ In the case of this function, that coefficient -
    the first one in the returned array - is always taken as one. (If
    for some reason you have one other point, the only automatic way
    presently to leverage that information is to use ``polyfit``.)

    The characteristic polynomial, :math:`p_a(t)`, of an `n`-by-`n`
    matrix **A** is given by

        :math:`p_a(t) = \\mathrm{det}(t\\, \\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{A})`,

    where **I** is the `n`-by-`n` identity matrix. [2]_

def polyfit(x, y, deg, rcond=..., full=..., w=..., cov=...):
    """
    Least squares polynomial fit.

    Fit a polynomial ``p(x) = p[0] * x**deg + ... + p[deg]`` of degree `deg`
    to points `(x, y)`. Returns a vector of coefficients `p` that minimises
    the squared error in the order `deg`, `deg-1`, ... `0`.

    The `Polynomial.fit <numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial.fit>` class
    method is recommended for new code as it is more stable numerically. See
    the documentation of the method for more information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int
        Degree of the fitting polynomial
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (M,), optional
        Weights to apply to the y-coordinates of the sample points. For
        gaussian uncertainties, use 1/sigma (not 1/sigma**2).
    cov : bool or str, optional
        If given and not `False`, return not just the estimate but also its
        covariance matrix. By default, the covariance are scaled by
        chi2/sqrt(N-dof), i.e., the weights are presumed to be unreliable
        except in a relative sense and everything is scaled such that the
        reduced chi2 is unity. This scaling is omitted if ``cov='unscaled'``,
        as is relevant for the case that the weights are 1/sigma**2, with
        sigma known to be a reliable estimate of the uncertainty.

    Returns
    -------
    p : ndarray, shape (deg + 1,) or (deg + 1, K)
        Polynomial coefficients, highest power first.  If `y` was 2-D, the
        coefficients for `k`-th data set are in ``p[:,k]``.

    residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond
        Present only if `full` = True.  Residuals is sum of squared residuals
        of the least-squares fit, the effective rank of the scaled Vandermonde
        coefficient matrix, its singular values, and the specified value of
        `rcond`. For more details, see `linalg.lstsq`.

    V : ndarray, shape (M,M) or (M,M,K)
        Present only if `full` = False and `cov`=True.  The covariance
        matrix of the polynomial coefficient estimates.  The diagonal of
        this matrix are the variance estimates for each coefficient.  If y
        is a 2-D array, then the covariance matrix for the `k`-th data set
        are in ``V[:,:,k]``


    Warns
    -----
    RankWarning
        The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
        deficient. The warning is only raised if `full` = False.

        The warnings can be turned off by

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', np.RankWarning)

    See Also

    Notes
    -----
    The solution minimizes the squared error

    .. math ::
        E = \\sum_{j=0}^k |p(x_j) - y_j|^2

    in the equations::

        x[0]**n * p[0] + ... + x[0] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[0]
        x[1]**n * p[0] + ... + x[1] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[1]
        ...
        x[k]**n * p[0] + ... + x[k] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[k]

    The coefficient matrix of the coefficients `p` is a Vandermonde matrix.

    `polyfit` issues a `RankWarning` when the least-squares fit is badly
    conditioned. This implies that the best fit is not well-defined due
    to numerical error. The results may be improved by lowering the polynomial
    degree or by replacing `x` by `x` - `x`.mean(). The `rcond` parameter
    can also be set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting
    fit may be spurious: including contributions from the small singular
    values can add numerical noise to the result.

    Note that fitting polynomial coefficients is inherently badly conditioned
    when the degree of the polynomial is large or the interval of sample points
    is badly centered. The quality of the fit should always be checked in these
    cases. When polynomial fits are not satisfactory, splines may be a good
    alternative.

def polydiv(u, v):
    """
    Returns the quotient and remainder of polynomial division.

    The input arrays are the coefficients (including any coefficients
    equal to zero) of the "numerator" (dividend) and "denominator"
    (divisor) polynomials, respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    u : array_like or poly1d
        Dividend polynomial's coefficients.

    v : array_like or poly1d
        Divisor polynomial's coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    q : ndarray
        Coefficients, including those equal to zero, of the quotient.
    r : ndarray
        Coefficients, including those equal to zero, of the remainder.

    See Also
    --------
    poly, polyadd, polyder, polydiv, polyfit, polyint, polymul, polysub
    polyval

    Notes
    -----
    Both `u` and `v` must be 0-d or 1-d (ndim = 0 or 1), but `u.ndim` need
    not equal `v.ndim`. In other words, all four possible combinations -
    ``u.ndim = v.ndim = 0``, ``u.ndim = v.ndim = 1``,
    ``u.ndim = 1, v.ndim = 0``, and ``u.ndim = 0, v.ndim = 1`` - work.

    Examples
    --------
    .. math:: \\frac{3x^2 + 5x + 2}{2x + 1} = 1.5x + 1.75, remainder 0.25

    >>> x = np.array([3.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    >>> y = np.array([2.0, 1.0])
    >>> np.polydiv(x, y)

class poly1d:
    """
    A one-dimensional polynomial class.

    A convenience class, used to encapsulate "natural" operations on
    polynomials so that said operations may take on their customary
    form in code (see Examples).

    Parameters
    ----------
    c_or_r : array_like
        The polynomial's coefficients, in decreasing powers, or if
        the value of the second parameter is True, the polynomial's
        roots (values where the polynomial evaluates to 0).  For example,
        ``poly1d([1, 2, 3])`` returns an object that represents
        :math:`x^2 + 2x + 3`, whereas ``poly1d([1, 2, 3], True)`` returns
        one that represents :math:`(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x -6`.
    r : bool, optional
        If True, `c_or_r` specifies the polynomial's roots; the default
        is False.
    variable : str, optional
        Changes the variable used when printing `p` from `x` to `variable`
        (see Examples).

    Examples
    --------
    Construct the polynomial :math:`x^2 + 2x + 3`:

    >>> p = np.poly1d([1, 2, 3])
    >>> print(np.poly1d(p))
       2
    1 x + 2 x + 3

    Evaluate the polynomial at :math:`x = 0.5`:

    >>> p(0.5)
    4.25

    Find the roots:

    >>> p.r
    array([-1.+1.41421356j, -1.-1.41421356j])
    >>> p(p.r)
    array([ -4.44089210e-16+0.j,  -4.44089210e-16+0.j]) # may vary

    These numbers in the previous line represent (0, 0) to machine precision

    Show the coefficients:

    >>> p.c
    array([1, 2, 3])

    Display the order (the leading zero-coefficients are removed):

    >>> p.order
    2

    Show the coefficient of the k-th power in the polynomial
    (which is equivalent to ``p.c[-(i+1)]``):

    >>> p[1]
    2

    Polynomials can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided
    (returns quotient and remainder):

    >>> p * p
    poly1d([ 1,  4, 10, 12,  9])

    >>> (p**3 + 4) / p
    (poly1d([ 1.,  4., 10., 12.,  9.]), poly1d([4.]))

    ``asarray(p)`` gives the coefficient array, so polynomials can be
    used in all functions that accept arrays:

    >>> p**2 # square of polynomial
    poly1d([ 1,  4, 10, 12,  9])

    >>> np.square(p) # square of individual coefficients
    array([1, 4, 9])

    The variable used in the string representation of `p` can be modified,
    using the `variable` parameter:

    >>> p = np.poly1d([1,2,3], variable='z')
    >>> print(p)
       2
    1 z + 2 z + 3

    Construct a polynomial from its roots:

    >>> np.poly1d([1, 2], True)
    poly1d([ 1., -3.,  2.])

    This is the same polynomial as obtained by:

    >>> np.poly1d([1, -1]) * np.poly1d([1, -2])
    poly1d([ 1, -3,  2])

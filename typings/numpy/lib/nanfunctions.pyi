    Return minimum of an array or minimum along an axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    When all-NaN slices are encountered a ``RuntimeWarning`` is raised and
    Nan is returned for that slice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose minimum is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the minimum is computed. The default is to compute
        the minimum of the flattened array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary. See

    Returns
    -------
    nanmin : ndarray
        An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified axis
        removed.  If `a` is a 0-d array, or if axis is None, an ndarray
        scalar is returned.  The same dtype as `a` is returned.

    Notes
    -----
    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.
    Positive infinity is treated as a very large number and negative
    infinity is treated as a very small (i.e. negative) number.

    If the input has a integer type the function is equivalent to np.min.

    Notes
    -----
    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the non-NaN elements along the axis
    divided by the number of non-NaN elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32`.  Specifying a
    higher-precision accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can alleviate
    this issue.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : {int, sequence of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the medians are computed. The default
        is to compute the median along a flattened version of the array.
        A sequence of axes is supported since version 1.9.0.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
       If True, then allow use of memory of input array `a` for
       calculations. The input array will be modified by the call to
       `median`. This will save memory when you do not need to preserve
       the contents of the input array. Treat the input as undefined,
       but it will probably be fully or partially sorted. Default is
       False. If `overwrite_input` is ``True`` and `a` is not already an
       `ndarray`, an error will be raised.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If this is anything but the default value it will be passed
        through (in the special case of an empty array) to the
        `mean` function of the underlying array.  If the array is
        a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
        will raise a RuntimeError.

    Returns
    -------
    median : ndarray
        A new array holding the result. If the input contains integers
        or floats smaller than ``float64``, then the output data-type is
        ``np.float64``.  Otherwise, the data-type of the output is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    --------
    mean, median, percentile

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the median of ``V`` is the
    middle value of a sorted copy of ``V``, ``V_sorted`` - i.e.,
    ``V_sorted[(N-1)/2]``, when ``N`` is odd and the average of the two
    middle values of ``V_sorted`` when ``N`` is even.

    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10.0, 7, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
    >>> a[0, 1] = np.nan

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array, containing
        nan values to be ignored.
    q : array_like of float
        Percentile or sequence of percentiles to compute, which must be between
        0 and 100 inclusive.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the percentiles are computed. The
        default is to compute the percentile(s) along a flattened
        version of the array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow the input array `a` to be modified by intermediate
        calculations, to save memory. In this case, the contents of the input
        `a` after this function completes is undefined.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to
        use when the desired percentile lies between two data points
        ``i < j``:

        * 'linear': ``i + (j - i) * fraction``, where ``fraction``
          is the fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i``
          and ``j``.
        * 'lower': ``i``.
        * 'higher': ``j``.
        * 'nearest': ``i`` or ``j``, whichever is nearest.
        * 'midpoint': ``(i + j) / 2``.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

        If this is anything but the default value it will be passed
        through (in the special case of an empty array) to the
        `mean` function of the underlying array.  If the array is
        a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
        will raise a RuntimeError.

    Returns
    -------
    percentile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single percentile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple percentiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the percentiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    percentile, median, mean
    nanquantile : equivalent to nanpercentile, but with q in the range [0, 1].

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the ``q``-th percentile of
    ``V`` is the value ``q/100`` of the way from the minimum to the
    maximum in a sorted copy of ``V``. The values and distances of
    the two nearest neighbors as well as the `interpolation` parameter
    will determine the percentile if the normalized ranking does not
    match the location of ``q`` exactly. This function is the same as
    the median if ``q=50``, the same as the minimum if ``q=0`` and the
    same as the maximum if ``q=100``.

    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10., 7., 4.], [3., 2., 1.]])

        Array containing numbers whose variance is desired.  If `a` is not an

        "Delta Degrees of Freedom": the divisor used in the calculation is
        ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN

    -------
    variance : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the variance,
        otherwise return a reference to the output array. If ddof is >= the

    Notes
    -----
    The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean,
    i.e.,  ``var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2)``.

    The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.
    If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used
    instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an
    unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite
    population.  ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the
    variance for normally distributed variables.

    Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the ``dtype``
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    For this function to work on sub-classes of ndarray, they must define
    `sum` with the kwarg `keepdims`

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])

    Notes
    -----
    The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
    deviations from the mean: ``std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))``.

    The average squared deviation is normally calculated as
    ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.  If, however, `ddof` is
    specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used instead. In standard
    statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an unbiased estimator of the
    variance of the infinite population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum
    likelihood estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables.
    The standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of
    the estimated variance, so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an
    unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.

    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute value before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same
    precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause

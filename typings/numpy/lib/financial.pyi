    Examples
    --------
    What is the future value after 10 years of saving $100 now, with
    an additional monthly savings of $100.  Assume the interest rate is
    5% (annually) compounded monthly?

    >>> np.fv(0.05/12, 10*12, -100, -100)
    15692.928894335748

    By convention, the negative sign represents cash flow out (i.e. money not
    available today).  Thus, saving $100 a month at 5% annual interest leads
    to $15,692.93 available to spend in 10 years.

    -------

    The payment is computed by solving the equation::

    or, when ``rate == 0``::

      fv + pv + pmt * nper == 0

    for ``pmt``.

    Note that computing a monthly mortgage payment is only
    one use for this function.  For example, pmt returns the
    periodic deposit one must make to achieve a specified
    future balance given an initial deposit, a fixed,
    periodically compounded interest rate, and the total
    number of periods.

    Examples
    --------
    What is the present value (e.g., the initial investment)
    of an investment that needs to total $15692.93
    after 10 years of saving $100 every month?  Assume the
    interest rate is 5% (annually) compounded monthly.

    >>> np.pv(0.05/12, 10*12, -100, 15692.93)
    -100.00067131625819

    By convention, the negative sign represents cash flow out
    (i.e., money not available today).  Thus, to end up with
    $15,692.93 in 10 years saving $100 a month at 5% annual
    interest, one's initial deposit should also be $100.

    If any input is array_like, ``pv`` returns an array of equal shape.
    Let's compare different interest rates in the example above:

    >>> a = np.array((0.05, 0.04, 0.03))/12
    >>> np.pv(a, 10*12, -100, 15692.93)
    array([ -100.00067132,  -649.26771385, -1273.78633713]) # may vary

    So, to end up with the same $15692.93 under the same $100 per month
    "savings plan," for annual interest rates of 4% and 3%, one would
    need initial investments of $649.27 and $1273.79, respectively.

    The IRR is perhaps best understood through an example (illustrated
    using np.irr in the Examples section below).  Suppose one invests 100
    units and then makes the following withdrawals at regular (fixed)
    intervals: 39, 59, 55, 20.  Assuming the ending value is 0, one's 100
    unit investment yields 173 units; however, due to the combination of
    compounding and the periodic withdrawals, the "average" rate of return
    is neither simply 0.73/4 nor (1.73)^0.25-1.  Rather, it is the solution
    (for :math:`r`) of the equation:

    .. math:: -100 + \\frac{39}{1+r} + \\frac{59}{(1+r)^2}
     + \\frac{55}{(1+r)^3} + \\frac{20}{(1+r)^4} = 0

    In general, for `values` :math:`= [v_0, v_1, ... v_M]`,
    irr is the solution of the equation: [2]_

    .. math:: \\sum_{t=0}^M{\\frac{v_t}{(1+irr)^{t}}} = 0

@array_function_dispatch(_npv_dispatcher)
def npv(rate, values):
    """
    Returns the NPV (Net Present Value) of a cash flow series.

    .. deprecated:: 1.18

       `npv` is deprecated; for details, see NEP 32 [1]_.
       Use the corresponding function in the numpy-financial library,
       https://pypi.org/project/numpy-financial.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate : scalar
        The discount rate.
    values : array_like, shape(M, )
        The values of the time series of cash flows.  The (fixed) time
        interval between cash flow "events" must be the same as that for
        which `rate` is given (i.e., if `rate` is per year, then precisely
        a year is understood to elapse between each cash flow event).  By
        convention, investments or "deposits" are negative, income or
        "withdrawals" are positive; `values` must begin with the initial
        investment, thus `values[0]` will typically be negative.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float
        The NPV of the input cash flow series `values` at the discount
        `rate`.

    Warnings
    --------
    ``npv`` considers a series of cashflows starting in the present (t = 0).
    NPV can also be defined with a series of future cashflows, paid at the
    end, rather than the start, of each period. If future cashflows are used,
    the first cashflow `values[0]` must be zeroed and added to the net
    present value of the future cashflows. This is demonstrated in the
    examples.

    Notes
    -----
    Returns the result of: [2]_

       Addison-Wesley, 2003, pg. 346.

    Examples
    --------
    Consider a potential project with an initial investment of $40 000 and
    projected cashflows of $5 000, $8 000, $12 000 and $30 000 at the end of
    each period discounted at a rate of 8% per period. To find the project's
    net present value:

    >>> rate, cashflows = 0.08, [-40_000, 5_000, 8_000, 12_000, 30_000]
    >>> np.npv(rate, cashflows).round(5)
    3065.22267

    It may be preferable to split the projected cashflow into an initial
    investment and expected future cashflows. In this case, the value of
    the initial cashflow is zero and the initial investment is later added
    to the future cashflows net present value:

    >>> initial_cashflow = cashflows[0]
    >>> cashflows[0] = 0
    >>> np.round(np.npv(rate, cashflows) + initial_cashflow, 5)
    3065.22267

Python 3.X compatibility tools.

While this file was originally intended for Python 2 -> 3 transition,
it is now used to create a compatibility layer between different
minor versions of Python 3.

While the active version of numpy may not support a given version of python, we
allow downstream libraries to continue to use these shims for forward
compatibility with numpy while they transition their code to newer versions of
Python.
